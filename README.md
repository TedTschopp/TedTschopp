# Ted Tschopp

Rolling Initiative!

I’m a **Senior Enterprise Architect** based in **Los Angeles**, focused on **enterprise-scale digital automation** and the practical realities of adopting AI in large organizations: platform shape, guardrails, operating models, and the “work between the work.”

I write and publish tools at **TedT.org**: https://tedt.org

> **Note:** Unless explicitly stated otherwise, everything here is personal work and opinion — not speaking for my employer.

## What I’m focused on

- **Enterprise AI adoption**: governance, risk, measurement, and how teams actually ship value
- **Agentic systems**: orchestration, observability, controls, and workflow redesign
- **Software architecture**: platform thinking, integration patterns, and constraints that matter in the real world
- **Storytelling**: using narrative and metaphor to make complex systems understandable
- **TTRPGs & creative tooling**: generators, SRDs, and hobby-grade experiments that occasionally become real tools

## How I like to collaborate

- Be clear about the outcome and the constraints.
- Prefer small PRs with tight feedback loops.
- If we disagree, let’s write down assumptions and test them.
- I’m happy to debate ideas — it’s how the best versions show up.
